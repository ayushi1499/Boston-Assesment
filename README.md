# Project Overview
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Boston's competitive and expensive housing market, driven by high demand and limited supply. The analysis leveraged the Boston Assessment 2015 dataset, which contains 168,116 records and 56 columns, to extract key insights into property values, trends, and correlations.
Context: Boston's housing market is influenced by its many universities and colleges, attracting numerous students and faculty members. This demand, combined with limited supply, results in a highly competitive and expensive housing market.

# Key Analyses and Findings:

1.	Statistical Summary Chart:
•	Variables Analyzed: AV_LAND, AV_BLDG, GROSS_TAX, LAND_SF, GROSS_AREA, LIVING_AREA.
•	Insights:
•	Minimum values indicate some properties have no tax, land area, or building area.
•	Maximum values show the vast range in property values and sizes.

2.	Building Costs by Kitchen Type:
•	Types:
•	Full Eat-in Kitchen (F): Average cost $492.761K.
•	None (N): Highest average cost $1.51M.
•	One-person Kitchen (O): Average cost $513.10K.
•	Pull/Alcove Kitchen (P): Lowest average cost $342K.

3.	Building Costs Over Decades:
•	Peak: 1970s with $7.38M.
•	Lowest: 1930s with $729.747K.

4.	Land Costs Over Decades:
•	Peak: 1960s with $3.4M.
•	Lowest: 1930s with $326.176K.

5.	Gross Tax Over Decades:
•	Peak: 1970s with $86.6K.
•	Lowest: 1950s with $7303.

6.	Housing Availability Over Decades:
•	Peak: 1920s with 18,778 houses.
•	Lowest: 2010s with 1,939 houses.

7.	Structure Class Distribution:
•	Residential (R): Dominates at 79.28%.
•	Other Types: Structural Steel, Reinforced Concrete, Brick/Concrete, Wood/Frame, and Metal.

8.	Correlation Analysis:
•	Highest Correlation: Gross Area and Living Area (0.98888374).
•	Lowest Correlation: Gross Tax and Land Surface Area (0.002140853).

9.	Scatter Plots:
•	Building Cost vs. Land Cost: Weak linear dependence (R² = 0.4597596).
•	Land Cost vs. Land Surface Area: Weak linear dependence (R² = 0.654135).
•	Gross Tax vs. Living Area: Weak linear dependence (R² = 0.4544352).

10.	Linear Regression Models:
•	Model 1: Land Cost vs. Building Cost and Land Surface Area (R² = 0.859544618).
•	Model 2: Gross Tax vs. Living Area (R² = 0.4544352).

# Conclusion:
•	Kitchen Type: Not strongly correlated with building cost.
•	Historical Trends:
•	1960s-1970s: Decline in property values and increase in vacancies.
•	1980s-1990s: Resurgence due to economic boom and new developments.
•	1920s-1930s: Urban renewal and redevelopment.
•	Best Regression Model: Based on land cost and land surface area.

# Key Skills and Tools:
•	Data Analysis: Statistical analysis, correlation analysis, and trend identification.
•	Data Visualization: Created comprehensive charts and scatter plots to depict findings.
•	Programming Languages: Python for data processing and analysis.
•	Tools: Tableau for visualization, SQL for database management, Excel for data handling.
•	Statistical Techniques: Linear regression modeling to identify significant predictors.

# Impact: 
This project provided a detailed understanding of the Boston housing market's dynamics, helping stakeholders make informed decisions about property investments and policy-making. The analysis highlighted significant trends, correlations, and factors influencing property values and availability, contributing to a deeper understanding of the market's behavior over time.
